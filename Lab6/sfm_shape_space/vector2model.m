% INPUT: 
%
% v: a vector with all parameters you should estimate, following the order
% [{L_11, ..., L_K1, R_1 T_1} ... {L_1F, ..., L_KF, R_F T_F}, X_1, ..., X_K]
% i.e., for every frame until F, to include weight coefficients rotations
% and translations, and finally, the K shape vectors
%
% OUTPUT:
% R: camera rotations [2F X 3]
% T: camera translations [2F X 1]
% X: shape vectors [3P X K]
% L: weight coefficients [K X F]
